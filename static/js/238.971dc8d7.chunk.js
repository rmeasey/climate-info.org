CTIPe is a state of the art research tool used at the Space Weather Prediction Center to study thermosphere-ionosphere phenomena in order to develop nowcasting and forecasting algorithms for space weather. The objectives are to understand and quantify the importance of the upper-atmospheric mechanisms that affect human activities and to develop new monitoring and predicting techniques.","details":"Conditions in the ionosphere have a dramatic effect on the accuracy of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Geomagnetic storms can produce large gradients in TEC and the gradients can move making GNSS positioning difficult or impossible at times. The Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics Model (CTIPe) model is a large numerical code that runs about 30 minutes ahead of real-time based on Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) measurements and has the potential to forecast the state of the thermosphere/ionosphere system, including TEC variability. The model is run and the results are updated every 10 minutes, about 30 minutes ahead of real-time.","history":"The Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics (CTIPe) model is a non-linear, coupled thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere physically based numerical code that includes a self-consistent electrodynamics scheme for the computation of dynamo electric fields. The model consists of four distinct components which run concurrently and are fully coupled. Included are a global thermosphere, a high-latitude ionosphere, a mid and low-latitude ionosphere/plasmasphere and an electrodynamical calculation of the global dynamo electric field. The thermosphere model was originally developed by Fuller-Rowell (Fuller-Rowell and Rees, [1980], Rees et al., [1980]) and is fully described in the PhD thesis of Fuller-Rowell [1981]. The high-latitude ionospheric model was developed by S. Quegan (Quegan, [1982]; Quegan et al., [1982]). The model of Earth\u2019s mid- and low-latitude plasmasphere is based on the Bailey [1983] model. These first three components are described in more detail under the name of coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere (CTIP) by Millward et al., [1996]. The electrodynamic calculation was developed by Richmond et al., [1992] and was included in the CTIP model by Millward, [2001] resulting in the creation of CTIPe.","sourceName":"Space Weather Prediction Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","sourceUrl":"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/ctipe-total-electron-content-forecast"},{"title":"GPS L1 Range Error from Total Electron Content","description":"The ionosphere is a layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere that starts around 80 kilometers above the surface and extends up to about 600 kilometers.

It is based on the averages of all earthquakes during a given time interval. GSAL is a numerical value in the range of 0 to 10 that indicates the current level of seismic activity worldwide (from low to extreme). It is calculated by combining the energy of all earthquakes known worldwide during a specific time interval (the default is the last 24 hours). It corresponds to the theoretical magnitude of all earthquakes during the specified period that occur together in a single event. This value represents a moving average that changes constantly as new earthquakes occur. It allows monitoring the occurrence of clusters of larger quakes around the world, typically fluctuating around moderate (\u201egreen\u201c) values around 6.0.","details":"GSAL also considers: - It is assumed that all quakes above magnitude 5 will be registered; these quakes will be weighted by a factor of 1. - It is also assumed that a significant number of smaller magnitude quakes will go unnoticed due to the inability of global seismic network coverage to detect all quakes below magnitude 5. Based on statistical information from areas with very good coverage of even small quakes (eg. For example, in California, Italy, etc.), a small correction is made for the actual number of smaller quakes below magnitude 5. This weight factor for smaller quakes ranges from 1.3 for magnitude 4.5 to 4.9 quakes to five times that for magnitude 2.0 to 2.9 quakes. However, since the larger quakes contribute much more to global energy release than all the smaller ones combined, the effect of this correction, that is, assuming there are more smaller quakes than recorded, is actually quite small.","history":"","sourceName":"Volcano Discovery","sourceUrl":"https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/de/erdbeben/global-seismic-activity-level.html"},{"title":"Electron Ring Current Forecast","description":"Three days ensemble forecast of ring current electron flux for 8keV, 16keV and 30keV particles at 85\xb0 pitch angle using the VERB-4D code.
