# Climate-Info
Created by a guy who just wanted all the climate web stuff he looks at in one place.

Nothing fancy.

## Run With It
If you fancy adding stuff, augmenting stuff, or just generally want to do stuff on the site, get in touch. Shouldn't be a problem.

## The Ususal Scripts:
You know the sort of things...

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

### GitPages Deploy
I've set up a workflow for updating the site hosted in GitPages:
```
npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy climate-info.org to GitHub Pages"
```
